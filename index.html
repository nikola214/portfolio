        <h2>Hi, I'm Nikola — a Computer Science student with a strong interest in building useful apps, web applications, and practical software.</h2>

        <p>I enjoy programming, solving problems, and turning ideas into working projects. Most of my work so far includes university assignments, small personal projects, 
        and experiments with Python, Java, C, and web technologies. My goal is to gain experience by building new and more challenging projects in the near future. I'm currently focusing on:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Building web applications and websites</li>
            <li>Developing software and applications</li>
            <li>Learning programming languages and software architecture</li>
        </ul>

        <p>I aim to continuously improve my skills and work on projects that are both useful and challenging.</p>
